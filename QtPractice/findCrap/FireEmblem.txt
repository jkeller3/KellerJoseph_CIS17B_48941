Camilla - A promoted wyvern rider, whose main weapon is axes, who has great base stats and growths, and joins early...where have I heard that before... Camilla is one of the best units in Nohr joining in the middle of Chapter 10 when you are starting to really need the help and she can more or less easily kill everything on the map. Her base stats put her above nearly all your units and the enemies. She can use tomes to give her some 1-2 range that isn't hand axes and the Revenant knight has some pretty great skills for her to pick up. However, unlike Haar(RD) her speed cap actually hurts her as she caps out at 28 speed as a Revenant Knight meaning she won't be able to double most of the mooks in the late game and will find herself doubled by some of the faster enemies like Elite Ninjas and TrueBlades. Nonetheless she can still contribute and her skills are pretty great so she won't become a burden.

Belka/Berka - She joins the same time as Camilla, but as an average wyvern rider, so she is very easy to look over since she is outclassed by Camilla. However, outclassed doesn't mean useless and Belka is a great unit and is the only other flier you get in Nohr aside from reclassing and pairings. She is also fairly good at reclassing since she has the fighter line which lets her keep her Axe rank which is always great not having to deal with E.
